# self_contained_gratitude

This is a self contained gratitude app.

It uses Flutter, SQLite and Flutter_Local_Notifications.

It's completely self contained and doesn't require or ask for permission to connect to the internet.

The goal of the app is to have a simple place to put the things you're grateful for without having to:
1. Wait on internet/severs.
2. Remind you of what you've been grateful for in the past, hopefully brining you some joy.
3. Keeping your data owned by you and not being forced to share these vulnerable moments with a company or developers.
